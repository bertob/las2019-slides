### Abstract

A frequent meme in our community is the idea that there is a "Linux desktop" platform, which exists on a similar level to other operating systems. The truth is that this is not the case, never will be, and pretending that it is is a major reason why it is so hard to build a viable app ecosystem. App developers are faced with a myriad of different environments, no one good path to ship apps to people or get paid for their work, and things like theming ripping out API from under them randomly. Is it any wonder that we're having a hard time attracting developers?

In this talk we make the case that instead of a vague "Linux desktop" and dozens of distributions repackaging the same software we need separate, well defined, vertically integrated platforms. Thanks to new technologies such as Flatpak and OSTree this is starting to become a reality, and proejcts like elementary are leading the way for what these vertically integrated platforms could look like. In this talk we'll outline a possible future where we replace the current distribution model with healthy ecosystems, and how we can make it happen.
